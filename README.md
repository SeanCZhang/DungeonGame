# DungeonGame
A simple text game running in the java console. You name your player, select the difficulty (normal/easy), and fight 10 battles with the enemies getting harder every 3rd of the way there with the boss being at the 10th battle. The player can attack, parry, and block. After each won battle, the player HP resets to full and can choose a stat to increase.
